# UFOs

## Overview
### The purpose of the project is to update the webpage so that a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings is possible. This will be done by adding table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
### A user can perform a search by choosing one of the filters on the left hand side and typing in the specific date, city, state, country, or shape they want to search for. The best way to search is the use the same syntax as the placeholder in the input box. For example, in the 'State' filter, the example state is Arizona which is indicated by it abbrivation in lowercase letters. So if you wanted to search for UFO sightings in New Jersey you would type 'nj' then press Enter.

## Summary
### One drawback of this webpage is that you cannot use multiple filters at the same time. It only recognizes the most recent input and returns all of the results that capture that. For example, in the previous photo we see that the results are showing all of the UFO sightings in New Jersey. However we can see that the date of '1/12/2010' and the shape 'triangle' had been previously entered in the filter search. The results did not show which, if any, UFO sightings took place in NJ on 1/12/10 in the shape of a triangle. 

### A recommendation would be to correct this drawback and to update the filter search futher so that a user can narrow down their search by applying multiple filters to the data at once, as opposed to one filter on the data at a time. A second recommendation would be to extend the filter to the 'Duration' column and the 'Comments' column so users can search the column by keywords.
